// the difference between varuniversial variable/ data container . let is  a variable that is expected to change const is  a variable that will not change. stays constant
 let a = 2000
 let b = 1000 
 let c = 1000

 // combine variables that when combined will be 4000
 
 
 // is a function where when you put a variabgle inside of the round brackets, it will show the value in the terminal 
 console.log(a)
 console.log(b)
 console.log(c)

 // a scenerio when you would use the let varaible is when you want to but something ina container. and when you want to use const when whenever you want to declare a variable whose value should not be reassigned
  
// three things that would improve this class would be less talking more group woirk and class treats for when we do a good job
