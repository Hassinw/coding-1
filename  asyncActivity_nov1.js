 //  1. the difference between var,let,const

"var - standard variable. short for variable. this can be used in any context   "
"let -this a varible where the data can change."
"const - this a vara=ibale where the data need to remain constant. canot change"



// 2. create 3 variable that multiply into 4000
var a = 2
var b = 2
var c = 1000
console.log(a* b* c);


 
 
 

 //  4. a scenerio when you would use the let varaible is when you want something to be a draft like an email. and when you want to use const when you use your final draft and want it to be permanant
  
// 5. three things that would improve this class would be less talking more group woirk and class treats for when we do a good job.
